# InsertionSort

This is a basic sorting algorithm that that iterates over an array, takes an element from the input array and finds it's correct location within the sorted array and inputs the element at that location. The loop continues while the inner index counter is less than 0 and is greater than the current item. Once those conditions are met, the remainder of the array is assumed to be sorted and the array is returned.
